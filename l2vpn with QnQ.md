# Scenario
An existing client with many service has one interface dedicated (PE1 to CE1) carrying a mix of services vlan-ccc (for layer 2circuit) and routed IP services.
Now the client wants to have an additional layer 2 circuit to connect CE1 and new site CE3 in which they will be able to add/remove vlans as they wish without service provider intervention (this has to be achieved with no change to current setup).
